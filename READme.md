# <Coding-Quiz>

## Description

The goal with this project was to create a coding quiz that not only told the user if they are right or wrong, but also used the timer mechanism to generate a score. At the end of this quiz, the user is able to add their initials to their score to add to a highscore/leading score dashboard for posterity's sake when they return the quiz again. 

This project allowed me to show my JavaScript skills and learn more about how interactive you can make your HTML webpages. 

## Installation

Open the index.html file in your web browser to access the quiz. 
## Usage

Begin the quiz by clicking "Begin Quiz!" and answer the questions as they appear. At the end of the quiz, enter your initials. If your score beats your previous highscores, your score will be shown in the window.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

Inside this project, you will see a quiz feature and a score dashboard feature.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
